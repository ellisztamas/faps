    "Before committing to the time and cost of genotyping samples for a paternity study, it is always sensible to run simulations to test the likely statistical power of your data set. This can help with important questions regaridng study design, such as finding an appropriate balance between the number of families vs offspring per family, or identifying a minimum number of loci to type. Simulated data can also be useful in verifying the results of an analysis.\n",
