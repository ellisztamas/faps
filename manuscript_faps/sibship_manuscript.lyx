\begin_layout Abstract
Pedigree and sibship reconstruction are important methods in quantifying
 relationships and fitness of individuals in natural populations.
 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1513760521
Despite major advances in reconstruction of parentage and sibship groups,
 the majority of methods consider only the most likely relationships, and
 ignore uncertainty in the genealogy.
 If not accounted for, this uncertainty can lead to biased inference of
 relevant biological processes.
 Here we extend fractional parentage methods to jointly infer paternity
 and full sibships.

\change_inserted -1312060434 1513760568
 Current methods employ a Markov-chain-based algoithm to explore plausible
 possible
\change_unchanged
 
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513760690
pedigrees iteratively.
 This provides accurate results, but is time consuming.
 Here we develop a method to infer sibship and paternity relationships from
 half-sibling arrays of known maternity using hierachical clustering.
 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1513760730
In contrast to previous methods we employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm
 to identify plausible sibship configurations.
 This removes the need to explore probability space iteratively, as well
 as providing considerable increase in speed.
 
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513768527
Given realistic genotype data the method performs as well as the widely-used
 package 
\emph on
Colony
\emph default
, but is faster by two orders of magnitude.
 
\change_unchanged
Using simulations we show that the method performs well across contrasting
 mating scenarios, even when samples are large.
 We then apply the method to open pollinated arrays of the snapdragon 
\emph on
Antirrhinum majus
\emph default
, and find evidence for a high degree of multiple mating.
 Though we focus on diploid SNP data, the method does not depend on marker
 type and as such has broad applications in non-model systems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The genealogical pedigree of a population is a valuable piece of information
 for genetic studies because it conveys complete information about the relatedne
ss between individuals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pemberton2008wild"

\end_inset

.
 The pedigree of wild populations can be inferred from patterns of shared
 alleles among individuals based on marker data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blouin2003dna,jones2010practical"

\end_inset

.
 The simplest approach is to infer the parents of individual offspring,
 and build a pedigree from pairs or triplets of individuals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "meagher1986,meagher_thompson1986relationship,marshall1998"

\end_inset

.
 However, the accuracy of pedigree reconstruction can be increased by including
 as many sources of relevant information as possible 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "neff2001bayesian,wang2007parentage"

\end_inset

.
 One way to achieve this is to reconstruct parentage and sibling relationships
 simultaneously, because alleles shared among full siblings allow us to
 better identify their common parents than would be possible by considering
 each offspring individually 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sieberts2002relationship,wang2009"

\end_inset

.
 A major challenge is to find the best way to partition offspring groups
 to distinguish full-, half- and non-siblings, because the number of possible
 configurations is too large to enumerate, even for modest family sizes.

 For example, Colony repeatedly merges and splits full-sibship groups, and

 This provides accurate solutions, but can be slow, especially for large

 altered the method to

rely on estimates of relatedness among pairs of individuals rather than
 entire families
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513695968
run more efficiently with SNP data
\change_unchanged
.
 This was found to be less accurate than the full-likelihood method, but
 provides a substantial increase in speed and computational burden.
 In spite of this boost, it still relies on 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1513686933
MCMC
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513686939

 As such there is still scope to improve the efficiency method to infer
 sibling and paternity relationships from genetic markers.

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative way to group individuals into sibship groups is 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1513686298
to perform 
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513686299
through 
\change_unchanged
hierarchical clustering based on a metric of relatedness.
 Hierarchical clustering is a 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1511092060
very 
\change_unchanged
flexible machine-learning technique to identify plausible ways to group
 items based on some measure of how similar (or dissimilar) each

.
 First, a matrix of similarity between all pairs of items is created, and
 the closest items are joined sequentially to form distinct groups.
 This grouping is based on a linkage function of the distance between groups.
 Common linkage functions include the minimum, maximum or mean distance,
 but other functions are common.
 Hierarchical clustering does not return a single optimal configuration
 of groups, but rather a hierarchy of possible configurations that can be
 compared.

In the absence of perfect data, inference from pedigrees will be more reliable
 if we also account for uncertainty about parentage.
 In the simplest (and probably most commonly applied) approach, categorical
 parentage methods identify the most likely pedigree, which is assumed to
 be correct in subsequent analyses (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
before "e.g."
key "meagher1986,marshall1998,jones2003methods,anderson_garza2006"

 This assumption will tend to bias paternity towards highly homozygous candidate

 Markov-chain algorithms can account for uncertainty in parentage structure
 by sampling likely candidates in turn, and provide a posterior distribution
 of possible pedigrees

 An alternative, but overlooked framework for parentage inference is fractional
 parentage assignment, where all candidate parents are assigned a probability
 of parentage for each offspring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "devlin1988fractional,roeder1989application,nielsen2001statistical"

\end_inset

.
 This can be expressed efficiently in matrix form, and allows us to consider
 the probability of parentage for all candidates simultaneously.
 However, although this is valid for the parentage of individual offspring,
 it is more challenging to deal with the parentage of full sibships in a
 fractional framework, because by definition no two families can share both
 parents.

To account for terms describing shared fathers across sibships it is necessary

As before there will be generally be too many paths to enumerate.
 However, because most rows will contain one or a handful of large values
 and many small values, only a small number of the possible paths will explain
 most of the total probability, and we can approximate the likelihood of
 the partition by only considering these.

 The marginal probability that the

We can then estimate the the distribution of fertilities among candidates

 For most biological questions it is more appropriate compare the

 of candidate fathers on the mothers by identifying independent mating events.
 To do this, we employ a Monte Carlo sampling scheme similar to that described
 above, which allows us to account for the relative probabilities of each
 partition structure, while avoiding the possibility of drawing the same
 candidate for multiple full sibships.
 For partition 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{c}$

\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 sets of candidate fathers for each full sibship in proportion to their
 probabilities of paternity, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is very large (
\begin_inset Formula $\geq1000$

).
 We then remove sets for which the same candidate is represented more than
 once.
 These sets are resampled 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr(T_{c})N$
\end_inset

 times to weight samples by the probability of the partition.
 This procedure is repeated for each partition.
 Because 
\series bold

, this leaves a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 sets in superset 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 The fecundity of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -1312060434 1513096933
The situation is more complicated when the question directly concerns paternity.

 this is invalid, because it allows for the male being the father of multiple

Family-structure scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first set of simulations we investigated inference of family structure
 for half-sibling arrays of 20 offspring under four contrasting scenarios:
 (1) even sibship sizes (four full-sibships of five offspring); (2) a single
 family (one full sibship of 20 offspring); (3) all half-siblings (20 full
 sibships of one offspring); (4) reproductive skew (one full sibship of
 ten individuals plus ten families of one offspring).
 For each scenario below we simulated genotypes for a single mother, as
 well as 100, 250, 500, 1000 or 2000 candidate males based on between 30
 and 100 unlinked SNP loci.
 SNP minor allele frequencies were drawn from a uniform distribution between
 0.3 and 0.5.
 We simulated offspring genotypes based on parental genotypes and Mendelian
 inheritance.
 We then added mutated to adult and offspring genotypes at random with per-locus
 probabilities of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

=0.0015, 0.005, 0.01, or 0.015 to simulate errors in genotyping.

Full-sibship size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the effect of overall offspring sample size we repeated simulations
 for the even-sibship-size mating scenario, but using full-sibship sizes
 of 2, 10, 25, 50 or 100 individuals.
 Since these simulations were computationally intensive we only used 250
 candidate males, 50 loci, and

\change_inserted -1312060434 1513092102
To investigate the sensitivity of sibship inference to the number of Monte
 Carlo draws used to estimate the likelihood of a partition structure we
 repeated simulations of the four family-structure scenarios described above
 using

 draws.
 We performed simulations assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

=0.0015 and 50 loci.
 For each simulated dataset, we assessed how much of the probability space
 of possible sibship and paternity relationships had been explored by summing
 the likelihoods for each partition structure inferred from hierarchical
 clustering.
 We also inferred the effect of changing the number of draws on the accuracy
 of sibship inference.

 For all analyses we included information about the identity of the mother

 We note that inference based on pairwise relationships only is expected
 to perform more poorly than FL and FPLS, but we include it here for reference.

 Since Colony2 aims to find a maximum-likelihood solution to sibship assignment
 we report accuracy based on the most-likely partition structure, but compare

\begin_layout Standard
To estimate per locus error rates associated with KASPR sequencing repeated
 DNA extraction and genotyping for two independent tissue samples from each

 This generated 23,720 per-locus diploid genotypes, of which 0.13% differed
 between samples from the same individual.
 Based on this we used genotyping error rates of 0.0013 for analyses with
 FAPS

Unfortunately, the silica gel used to dry the offspring tissue did not have
 sufficient desiccating power, and the quality offspring DNA was highly

\change_inserted -1312060434 1513763468
We have found that individuals with many loci that failed to amplify also
 had high genotype-error rates at the remaining loci (David Luke Field,
 unpublished data).
 Rather than risk biasing statistical and biological conclusions through
 such errors we applied a stringent data cleaning protocol prior to sibship
 analysis.

 After these data cleaning steps, the remaining 64 SNPs had on average 1.7%
 missing data in the offspring, and 0.8% in the adults, and heterozygosity
 between 0.20 and 0.55.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We analysed these data in two stages.
 We first examined the largest family in the dataset (2

) to assess three factors which might indicate errors in genealogical inference.
 If assignment is accurate, we expect that the most probable candidates
 should be no more related to one another, nor show an increase in the proportio
n of missing genotypes than would be expected by a random draw from the
 population.
 Similarly, we would expect that the most probable pollen donors are found
 in close to the maternal plant, but that less likely candidates are drawn
 from the spatial distribution of candidates at random.
 We used FAPS to cluster family

 and identify most-probable fathers for each offspring, accounting for uncertain
ty in sibship structure (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 We then compared distributions of pairwise relatedness, proportion of missing
 data and geographic location for the probable candidate fathers to those
 for the base population.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a second analysis we used a broader sample of families to infer the number
 of pollen donors that contribute to a seed capsule.
 To allow for direct comparison between families we used only those 18 families
 with 17 or more offspring.
 We sampled 17 offspring at random from each family, leaving a total of
 306 offspring.
 For each family we estimated the posterior distributions of the number
 of contributing sires and the size of each full sibship.
 We calculated 95% credible intervals based on the 2.5% and 97.% percentiles
 of these distributions.

Method robustness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the even-sibship-sizes mating scenario, all metrics of performance increased
 with the number of genotyped loci, and decreased with increasing genotyping
 error rates and the number of candidate fathers in the sample (figures
 2 and 3).
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.0015$
\end_inset

 and 2000 candidate males, 40 loci are sufficient to recover the true partition
 with >99% reliability, even for the largest sample

 of candidate males
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513159131
 (figures 2A and 2B) 
\change_unchanged
.
 In 99.9% of cases where the true partition was not recovered this was because
 FAPS identified an alternative partition structure with a higher likelihood
 of having generated the data than the true partition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that 50 loci sufficed to identify full-sibling relationships and
 true sires with >95% posterior probability (figure 2
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513159164
C
\change_unchanged
).
 Under all simulation parameter sets the distribution of family sizes remains
 centred on the true value, followed by a peak at family size of one, then
 one minus the true family size (figure 3).
 Thus, when true full siblings were assigned as half-siblings, this was
 in most cases due to a single individual being assigned to a singleton
 family.

FAPS correctly inferred >99.9%

 Partition structures that join two true full sibships, or otherwise over-estima
ted family size had posterior probabilities very close to zero (figure 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation results were very similar in three other mating scenarios simulated
 (supplementary figures 1-4).
 One notable departure from the patterns described above is that for the
 single-family and all-half-siblings scenarios FAPS recovered the true partition
 in all simulated datasets (supplementary figures 1-2).
 These scenarios represent the tip and base of the dendrogram (figure 1).

 regardless of family size
\change_inserted -1312060434 1513159312

 However, the variance in accuracy between samples decreased as family size
 increases, reflecting the increased information about sibling relationships
 with larger families.

In all simulations the proportion of probability space explored by the Monte
 Carlo sampling algorithm decreased as the number of candidate fathers increased
 (figure 5, left-hand side).
 Increasing the number of Monte Carlo draws tended to increase the proportion
 of space explored.
 This effect was stronger when there were more candidate fathers in the
 sample.
 The increase was especially strong in the

\begin_inset Formula $P_{half}$

 Further examination revealed that this was because the PLS method tended

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -1312060434 1513162948
For the parameter combination used here, neither FAPS nor Colony2 showed
 strong dependence on the number of candidate fathers in the sample.
 FAPS correctly identified true full- and half-sibship relationships with
 posterior probabilities close to one (figure 5).
 The distribution of number of full sibships was centred on the true value
 of four.
 For simulations with a large number of candidate males there was also support
 for five families, one of which was generally a singleton family.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -1312060434 1513162948
For the same datasets, Colony2 also correctly grouped 98% of full-sibling
 pairs into the same family, but reconstructed only 22% of half-sibling
 relationships.
 In more than 50% of cases with was because all individuals were assigned
 to a single full-sibling family.
 Consistent with this the distribution of family number is greatest for
 a single family, with a much smaller peak around the true number of families.
 The two methods thus showed contrasting patterns in the results, in that
 FAPS tended to slightly overestimate the number of families, whereas Colony2
 underestimated the true number of families.

In this paper we present a method for inferring sibship and paternity relationsh
ips from half-sibling arrays.
 We use hierarchical clustering to identify plausible ways to partition
 offspring into full sibships, and assess the support for different partition
 structures using Monte Carlo simulation.
 Given modest number of loci and realistic error rates the method is as
 accurate as the algorithms implemented in Colony, but is faster by two
 orders of magnitude.
 The Python package FAPS also includes tools to extract biologically relevant
 information regarding sibship and paternity structure that automatically
 accounts for uncertain about the exact pedigree.
 As such FAPS represents an accurate and efficient tool that allows for
 robust and efficient biological inference from genealogies.

Ever since the arrival of molecular markers, quantifying sibship relationships
 in natural populations has been an ongoing challenge for biologists 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "thompson1976inference,thompson1987parental,blouin2003dna"

\end_inset

.
 Here, we present an accurate and efficient method for jointly inferring
 paternity and sibship relationships, that provides a substantial speed
 advantage over similar software.
 Because the method is based on pairwise likelihoods of paternity it is
 of broad application, since it does not depend on marker type or genetic
 system, provided this likelihood can be calculated (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "anderson_garza2006,wang2014parentage"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, a key strength of the method are tools to explicitly account
 for uncertainty in sibling and paternity relationships.
 As such FAPS is a flexible tool that allows for robust biological inference
 from genealogies.

Using realistic sample sizes, a modest number of SNP loci error rates, FAPS
 performs well under a variety of contrasting sibship structures.
 This is true even when samples of offspring and candidate fathers are large,
 which previous work has found can be problematic for sibship assignment
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "almudevar2012new"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, FAPS never falsely assigned two full siblings to be half
 siblings.
 When there were errors in sibship assignment, single offspring tended to
 splinter into families on their own.
 Most such errors were due to individuals being assigned to a family on
 their own, rather with other individuals in a larger family (figure 3).
 These errors typically occurred when an unrelated candidate male had a
 higher likelihood of paternity than did the true sire due to stochasticity
 in Mendelian sampling.
 This phenomenon has been previously noted for both paternity

 and sibship

\end_inset

 assignment problems.
 In 97.8% of simulations in which the most likely partition was not the true
 partition, the most likely partition had a higher likelihood than the true
 partition.
 As such, the incorrect partitions identified by FAPS are in fact more consisten
t with the data than the true genealogy.

We found Monte Carlo simulation to be an efficient approach to estimating
 the likelihood of a partition, while excluding the possibility that multiple
 full sibships share a father.
 A drawback of this scheme is that there is no way to know how much of the
 probability space has been sampled for a given number of Monte Carlo draws.
 Increasing the number of Monte Carlo draws increased the proportion of
 probability space that could be explored, especially in samples with many
 candidate males, or smaller full sibship sizes (figure 5).
 This is not surprising, given that in these scenarios the space of possible
 configurations is much larger, and there is less information among full
 siblings to rule out unrelated candidate fathers.
 However, the number of draws had almost no effect on the accuracy of sibship
 inference (figure 5, right-hand side).
 This indicates that the most likely configurations can be sampled with
 a small number of draws, and that the accuracy of FAPS does not depend
 on the paramter choice for the number of Monte Carlo draws.

Our hierarchical clustering algorithm relies on a matrix of probabilities
 that pairs of offspring are full siblings.
 As well as having low statistical power 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wang2007parentage"

\end_inset

, pairwise sibship measures can be problematic in that any pair of three
 individuals can be compatible as full siblings sired by separate fathers,
 but incompatible as a single family sired by a single father.
 Several lines of evidence indicate that this issue is not a significant
 concern for this method.
 Firstly, the Monte Carlo sampling scheme explicitly evaluates the likelihood
 that the whole sibship was sired by individual candidate fathers.
 As noted above, simulations demonstrate that this returns accurate sibship
 and paternity configurations (figures 2-4, supporting figures 1-4).
 Finally, FAPS dramatically outperforms the pairwise-likelihood method implement
ed in Colony (figure 6).
 These observations indicate that any inherent weakness in using the heuristic
 pairwise metric has negligible negative impact on the accurcay of this
 method.

Our analysis of open-pollinated 
\emph on

 seed capsules found evidence for a large number of small full-sibling families
 in a half sibling array.
 Since a single seed capsule can contain hundreds of seed, our samples of
 17 offspring per array represent only a tiny fraction of the total seeds
 in the array.
 It is therefore likely that these full sibships are substantially larger
 than implied in 
\change_deleted -1312060434 1513089094

 Nevertheless, this demonstrates that a single seed capsule contains offspring
 from a large number of pollen donors, either through many independent pollinato
r visits, or through fewer visits by pollinators delivering mixed pollen
 loads.
 Since pollinator behaviour is a crucial mediator of gene flow among flowering
 plants, we are using these paternity data in ongoing work to investigate
 the interaction between flower colour and pollinator behaviour in the maintenan

 Furthermore, they were within close proximity to the maternal plant, as

 In contrast, the second-most probable set of candidate fathers were located
 across the population, as we would expect for unrelated individuals drawn

 This rate can be estimated through repeat genotyping of the same individuals.

\begin_layout Standard
A further source of error occurs where one or more loci fail to amplify
 for an individual, leaving missing data for that locus.
 Failing to account for these missing data causes candidate males with many
 failed loci to have high likelihoods of paternity, because the calculation

 multiplies over fewer loci.
 We account for these errors by correcting for the
