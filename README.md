# faps

FAPS stands for Fractional Analysis of Sibships and Paternity. It is a Python package for reconstructing genealogical relationships in wild populations in a way that accounts for uncertainty in the genealogy. It uses a clustering algorithm to sample plausible partitions of offspring into full sibling families, negating the need to apply an iterative search algorithm.

## Installation and uses

FAPS is built using the `Numpy` and `Scipy` libraries. For simulations, it also makes use of `Pandas` dataframes, and iPython widgets.

See the docs folder on the project repository page for more information about how to use the package.
