    """
    Create a matrix of probabilities that each pair of individuals in a half-sibling array are full siblings.
        
    If two individuals are full siblings, the likelihood is the product of the likelihoods that each is fathered
    by father i, or father j, etc. We therefore take the product of likelihoods for paternity for each candidtae,
    and sum across the products for each father to account for uncertainty.
    
    The majority of fathers will not contribute to paternity, but will cause noise in the estimation of pairwise
    sibship probability. For this reason the function works much better if the likelihood array has had most
    unlikely fathers, for example by setting the likelihood for fathers with three or more opposing homozygous
    loci to zero. This can be done with filter_dads().
    
    ARGUMENTS:
    paternity_probs: array of posterior probabilities of paternity.
    
    exp: Indicates whether the probabilities of paternity should be exponentiated before calculating pairwise
    probabilities of sibships. This gives a speed boost if this is to be repeated many times, but there may be
    a cost to accuracy.
    
    RETURNS:
    The function outputs a noffspring*noffspring matrix of log likelihoods of being full siblings.
